# Component Usage Rules

## Component Usage
- All reusable components are located in `resources/js/Components/**`.
- When using these components, you MUST check their defined props and maximize their usage.
- Always prefer using existing component props over re-implementing logic or styles manually.
- If a component has a prop that achieves the desired effect (e.g., `isWide`), use it instead of adding custom classes.

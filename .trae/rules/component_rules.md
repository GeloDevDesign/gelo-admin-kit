# Component Usage Rules

## Component Usage
- All reusable components are located in `resources/js/Components/**`.
- When using these components, you MUST check their defined props and maximize their usage.
- Always prefer using existing component props over re-implementing logic or styles manually.
- If a component has a prop that achieves the desired effect (e.g., `isWide`), use it instead of adding custom classes.
- When creating a new file or UI element, you MUST first look up the `resources/js/Components` directory to see if a suitable component already exists.
- Maximize the usage of all existing components to avoid duplication.
